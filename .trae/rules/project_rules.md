First, I’d like you to thoroughly scan my code to understand its structure and APIs. Then, please scan my database to see how it works and connects to my app. This will help us better understand the problem and find a suitable solution.

Please ensure that you don’t break the gear request logics. Remember, don’t guess a solution; be certain that it will work and won’t break existing functions or logics before implementing it.
