Readability & Clarity: Is the code easy to read and understand at a glance, without relying on any overly clever or obscure tricks? Favor clear, straightforward logic over “smart” one-liners that sacrifice clarity.

Naming Conventions: Are variable, function, and class names self-explanatory and consistent with the project’s naming conventions? Each name should clearly convey purpose to improve readability.

Inline Comments: Are comments used judiciously to explain the why behind complex or non-obvious code, rather than stating the obvious what? Good comments provide intent or rationale, whereas trivial comments are avoided.

Scannability & Style: Is the code formatted and structured for easy scanning? Check for consistent indentation, spacing, and logical grouping of code blocks, making it easy to follow the flow.

Consistency: Does the new code follow the same style and patterns as the existing codebase? Ensure it adheres to established project standards and doesn’t introduce a surprising style deviation.
