Requirement Fulfillment: Does the code implement the feature as intended and solve the stated problem? Verify it meets the specified requirements or user story acceptance criteria.

Edge Case Handling: Are edge cases and error conditions handled gracefully? Consider unusual or boundary inputs and ensure the code won’t break – every scenario should have an appropriate outcome or error message.

User Experience (UX): Is the user experience complete and polished? All UI states are covered – e.g. loading indicators, success/failure messages – and the workflow is intuitive with clear feedback for user actions.

Feature Flags: If this feature is behind a feature flag, is the flag gating implemented correctly? The feature should remain inactive when the flag is off, and enabling the flag cleanly activates the new functionality without side effects.

Performance Impact: Has the code’s performance been considered? No obvious bottlenecks like inefficient loops or unindexed queries – and if the feature is computationally heavy, there are mitigations or the impact is deemed acceptable.

Logging & Tracking: Are logging or analytics in place for this feature if needed? Ensure important actions/events are logged or metrics collected so the feature’s usage and health can be monitored.

Accessibility: Does the implementation consider accessibility standards? Check for things like proper alt text on images, form labels, keyboard navigation support, and sufficient color contrast so that all users can use the feature.
