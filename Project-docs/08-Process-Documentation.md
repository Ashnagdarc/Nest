### Sprint Cycle

**Sprint Duration:** 2 weeks

**Sprint Schedule:**

| Day | Activity | Time | Participants |
|-----|----------|------|--------------|
| Monday (Week 1) | Sprint Planning | 2 hours | Full team |
| Daily | Daily Standup | 15 min | Full team |
| Wednesday (Week 1) | Design Review | 1 hour | Designers, Tech Lead |
| Monday (Week 2) | Mid-Sprint Check | 30 min | Full team |
| Thursday (Week 2) | Sprint Review | 1 hour | Team + Stakeholders |
| Friday (Week 2) | Sprint Retrospective | 1 hour | Full team |

---

### Daily Standup Format

**Time:** 9:00 AM (15 minutes max)

**Each team member answers:**
1. What did I accomplish yesterday?
2. What will I work on today?
3. Are there any blockers?

**Standup Rules:**
- Keep it brief and focused
- Take detailed discussions offline
- Update task board during standup
- Identify blockers immediately

---

### Task Management

**Task Board Columns:**
1. **Backlog** - Prioritized list of work
2. **To Do** - Selected for current sprint
3. **In Progress** - Actively being worked on
4. **Code Review** - Awaiting peer review
5. **Testing** - In QA testing
6. **Done** - Completed and deployed

**Task Priority Levels:**
- **P0 - Critical:** System down, data loss (immediate)
- **P1 - High:** Major feature broken (within 24h)
- **P2 - Medium:** Minor issues (within sprint)
- **P3 - Low:** Nice to have (backlog)

---

### Story Estimation

**Estimation Scale (Story Points):**
- **1 point:** < 2 hours (trivial)
- **2 points:** 2-4 hours (simple)
- **3 points:** 4-8 hours (moderate)
- **5 points:** 1-2 days (complex)
- **8 points:** 2-3 days (very complex)
- **13 points:** > 3 days (needs breakdown)

**Estimation Guidelines:**
- Stories > 8 points should be broken down
- Include testing time in estimates
- Account for code review cycles
- Consider dependencies

---

## Git Branching Strategy

### Branch Structure

Nest uses **Git Flow** branching strategy:

```
main (production)
├── develop (integration)
│   ├── feature/add-equipment-search
│   ├── feature/notification-system
│   ├── bugfix/qr-scanner-ios
│   └── hotfix/security-patch
└── hotfix/critical-auth-bug (emergency)
```

---

### Branch Types

**Main Branches:**
- `main` - Production code (always deployable)
- `develop` - Integration branch for features

**Supporting Branches:**
- `feature/*` - New features
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*` - Emergency production fixes
- `release/*` - Release preparation

---

### Branch Naming Convention

```
<type>/<issue-number>-<short-description>

Examples:
feature/42-equipment-qr-codes

**Step 5: Merge After Approval**
```bash
# Squash and merge via GitHub UI
# Delete feature branch after merge
git branch -d feature/123-equipment-filters
git push origin --delete feature/123-equipment-filters
```

---

### Hotfix Workflow

For critical production issues:

```bash
# Create hotfix branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-auth-bug

# Fix the issue
# ... code ...

# Commit and push
git commit -am "fix: resolve authentication session timeout"
git push origin hotfix/critical-auth-bug

# Create PR to main
# After merge to main, also merge to develop
git checkout develop
git merge main
git push origin develop

# Tag the release
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Hotfix: Authentication session timeout"
git push origin v1.0.1
```

## Testing Process

### Testing Strategy

Nest follows a **Test Pyramid** approach:

```
        /\
       /E2E\          (Few, slow, expensive)
      /------\
     /  API  \        (Medium number)
    /----------\
   / UNIT TESTS \     (Many, fast, cheap)
  /--------------\
```

**Test Distribution:**
- 70% Unit Tests
- 20% Integration Tests
- 10% End-to-End Tests

---

### Test Types

**1. Unit Tests**
- Test individual functions/components
- Fast execution (< 1s per test)
- No external dependencies
- High coverage (>80%)

**Example: Component Test**
```typescript
// src/components/ui/Button.test.tsx
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import { Button } from './Button';

describe('Button Component', () => {
  it('renders with correct text', () => {
    render(<Button>Click Me</Button>);
    expect(screen.getByText('Click Me')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('calls onClick when clicked', () => {
    const handleClick = jest.fn();
    render(<Button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</Button>);
    
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Click Me'));
    expect(handleClick).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
  });

  it('is disabled when disabled prop is true', () => {
    render(<Button disabled>Click Me</Button>);
    expect(screen.getByText('Click Me')).toBeDisabled();
  });
});
```

**2. Integration Tests**
- Test multiple components together
- Test API routes
- Test database interactions
- Medium execution time

**Example: API Route Test**
```typescript
// src/app/api/gears/__tests__/route.test.ts
import { GET, POST } from '../route';
import { createMockRequest } from '@/test/utils';

describe('/api/gears', () => {
  describe('GET', () => {
    it('returns all gears', async () => {
      const request = createMockRequest();
      const response = await GET(request);
      const data = await response.json();

      expect(response.status).toBe(200);
      expect(data.data).toBeInstanceOf(Array);
      expect(data.error).toBeNull();
    });

    it('filters by category', async () => {
      const request = createMockRequest({
        searchParams: { category: 'Electronics' }
      });
      const response = await GET(request);
      const data = await response.json();

      expect(data.data.every(g => g.category === 'Electronics')).toBe(true);
    });
  });

  describe('POST', () => {
    it('creates new equipment', async () => {
      const gearData = {
        name: 'Test Equipment',
        category: 'Electronics',
        quantity: 5
      };

      const request = createMockRequest({ body: gearData });
      const response = await POST(request);
      const data = await response.json();

      expect(response.status).toBe(201);
      expect(data.data.name).toBe('Test Equipment');
    });

    it('validates required fields', async () => {
      const request = createMockRequest({ body: {} });
      const response = await POST(request);

      expect(response.status).toBe(400);
    });
  });
});
```

**3. End-to-End Tests**
- Test complete user flows
- Test across multiple pages
- Slower execution
- Critical paths only

---

### Running Tests

**Local Testing:**
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test Button.test.tsx

# Run tests matching pattern
npm test -- --testNamePattern="renders correctly"
```

**CI/CD Testing:**
Tests automatically run on:
- Every pull request
- Every push to develop/main
- Before deployment

---

### Test Coverage Requirements

**Minimum Coverage Targets:**
- Overall: 80%
- Critical paths: 100%
- API routes: 90%
- Components: 85%
- Utilities: 90%

**Coverage Report:**
```bash
npm run test:coverage

# View HTML report
open coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```

---

### Testing Best Practices

**DO:**
- Write tests before fixing bugs
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names
- Keep tests independent
- Mock external dependencies
- Test user behavior, not implementation

**DON'T:**
- Test implementation details
- Write flaky tests
- Skip tests with `.skip()`
- Duplicate test logic
- Make tests dependent on each other
- Test third-party libraries
