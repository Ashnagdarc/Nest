# Gear Reservation System Enhancements

This document outlines the enhancements made to the gear reservation system to address issues with gear status tracking, double-booking prevention, and admin notification consolidation.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Gear Status Synchronization**: When a calendar booking was approved, the gear status wasn't always properly updated, causing two problems:
   - The gear might not appear in the Check-in Gear page despite being checked out
   - The available quantity might not be properly decremented, allowing double-booking

2. **Admin Notification Fragmentation**: Admins had to check two separate places to manage gear-related approvals:
   - Admin Calendar page for calendar bookings
   - Manage Requests page for gear requests

3. **Maintenance Status Handling**: There was no mechanism to prevent booking gear that's under maintenance or handle cases where gear becomes unavailable between booking and checkout.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Gear Status Management

We created a comprehensive database function to handle all gear status updates in one place:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_gear_status_comprehensive(
    p_gear_id UUID,
    p_status TEXT,
    p_checked_out_to UUID,
    p_current_request_id UUID,
    p_last_checkout_date TIMESTAMPTZ,
    p_due_date TIMESTAMPTZ,
    p_available_quantity INTEGER,
    p_source TEXT DEFAULT 'manual'
) RETURNS VOID
```

This function:

- Updates the gear status, checked_out_to, and available_quantity fields
- Ensures proper synchronization between gears, gear_states, and request tables
- Validates input parameters to prevent invalid states
- Maintains detailed logs of all status changes

The existing `update_gear_checkout_status` function now calls this comprehensive function, maintaining backward compatibility.

### 2. Double-Booking Prevention

We added a function to check gear availability for a specific time period:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_gear_availability(
    p_gear_id UUID,
    p_start_date TIMESTAMPTZ,
    p_end_date TIMESTAMPTZ
) RETURNS TABLE (
    is_available BOOLEAN,
    available_quantity INTEGER,
    total_quantity INTEGER,
    current_status TEXT,
    conflicting_bookings INTEGER
)
```

This function checks:

- If the gear is under maintenance
- If the gear has enough available quantity
- If there are conflicting bookings for the requested period

We also added a trigger that prevents approving bookings when gear is unavailable:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION prevent_double_booking() RETURNS TRIGGER
```

### 3. Unified Admin Notification System

We created a new component `UnifiedNotificationsPanel` that shows both calendar bookings and gear requests that need attention:

```tsx
export function UnifiedNotificationsPanel() {
  // Component implementation
}
```

This component:

- Uses real-time subscriptions to stay up-to-date
- Shows pending calendar bookings and gear requests in a tabbed interface
- Provides direct links to review each item
- Displays counts of pending items

The component has been added to the admin dashboard for easy access.

### 4. Enhanced Calendar Booking Approval

We modified the calendar booking approval endpoint to check for maintenance status and availability before approving a booking:

```typescript
// Check if gear is under maintenance or otherwise unavailable
if (gearData.status === 'Under Repair') {
    return NextResponse.json(
        { error: 'This gear is currently under maintenance and cannot be booked.' },
        { status: 400 }
    );
}

// Check if gear is already fully booked for this period
const { data: availabilityCheck } = await supabase.rpc('check_gear_availability', {
    p_gear_id: booking.gear_id,
    p_start_date: booking.start_date,
    p_end_date: booking.end_date
});
```

## Backward Compatibility

These enhancements maintain backward compatibility with the existing code:

1. The `update_gear_checkout_status` function keeps the same signature and parameters
2. The calendar booking approval process still works the same way from the user's perspective
3. The unified notifications panel is an addition to the dashboard, not a replacement for existing pages
4. Admins can still use the separate calendar and requests pages as they did before

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Gear that has been checked out now properly appears in the Check-in Gear page
2. **Prevented Double-Booking**: The system now prevents approving bookings for gear that's already fully booked
3. **Better Admin Workflow**: Admins can see all pending approvals in one place
4. **Enhanced Data Integrity**: The comprehensive status update function ensures consistent data across all tables
5. **Better Error Handling**: The system now provides clear error messages when trying to approve invalid bookings
