# Check-in System Fixes

## Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Users See Items That Need to Be Checked In (Already Approved)

**Problem**: Users were seeing items in their check-in page that had already been approved by admins and should no longer appear.

**Root Cause**: The `useCheckedOutGears` hook was filtering gears by `status=Checked Out`, but after admin approval, gear status changes to `Available` or `Needs Repair`. However, the `checked_out_to` field wasn't being properly cleared in all cases.

**Fix**:

- Updated `useCheckedOutGears` hook to query gears directly from Supabase instead of using the API
- Changed the query to filter by `checked_out_to` field instead of just status
- Added support for `Pending Check-in` status gears that belong to the user
- **UPDATED**: Fixed query to exclude gears with status `Available` or `Needs Repair`

### Issue 2: "Unknown Gear" in Check-in History

**Problem**: Check-in history was showing "Unknown Gear" instead of actual gear names.

**Root Cause**: The query was trying to join with the `gears` table but the relationship wasn't working correctly, likely due to missing foreign key constraints or orphaned records.

**Fix**:

- Reverted to direct Supabase query instead of database function (which doesn't exist yet)
- Added fallback query logic in case the primary query fails
- Implemented proper foreign key constraints and data cleanup
- Added comprehensive error handling and debugging tools

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Fixed

- Updated `useCheckedOutGears` hook to use direct Supabase queries
- Improved error handling in check-in history queries
- Added debugging tools for troubleshooting
- **NEW**: Fixed query logic to exclude gears with status `Available` or `Needs Repair`
- **NEW**: Added specific gear issue fixing utilities
- **NEW**: Added database migration runner

### üîÑ In Progress

- Database migration needs to be applied
- Foreign key constraints need to be established
- Data cleanup needs to be performed

### üêõ Current Issue

- Items are still showing in check-in page despite fixes
- This suggests the database data needs to be cleaned up

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Run Database Migration

1. Go to `/admin/settings/database`
2. Click "Run Database Migration" button
3. This will clean up inconsistent data and establish proper constraints

### 2. Fix Specific Gear Issues

1. Still on `/admin/settings/database`
2. Click "Fix Specific Gear Issues" button
3. This specifically targets gears that have `checked_out_to` set but status is `Available`/`Needs Repair`

### 3. Test the Fix

1. Navigate to `/user/check-in` page
2. Check if the problematic items (Apple Keyboards, ATH-M20X, DJI items) are still showing
3. If they are, check the browser console for debug information

### 4. Verify Data Integrity

1. Back on `/admin/settings/database`
2. Click "Validate Data Integrity"
3. Review the results to ensure all issues are resolved

## Database Changes

### Migration: `20241201_fix_checkin_gear_relationships_simple.sql`

1. **Data Cleanup**:
   - Removes orphaned check-ins that reference non-existent gears
   - Clears `checked_out_to` field for gears with status `Available` or `Needs Repair`

2. **Foreign Key Constraints**:
   - Ensures proper relationship between `checkins.gear_id` and `gears.id`
   - Adds cascade delete behavior

3. **Performance Indexes**:
   - Added index on `checkins.gear_id`
   - Added index on `gears.checked_out_to`

4. **Automatic Triggers**:
   - Created trigger to automatically update gear status when check-in is approved
   - Ensures `checked_out_to` is cleared when status changes to `Available`/`Needs Repair`

## Code Changes

### 1. Updated `useCheckedOutGears` Hook

**File**: `src/hooks/check-in/useCheckedOutGears.ts`

- Changed from API call to direct Supabase query
- Updated filtering logic to use `checked_out_to` field
- Added support for `Pending Check-in` status
- **NEW**: Excludes gears with status `Available` or `Needs Repair`
- **NEW**: Added debug logging

### 2. Updated Check-in History Query

**File**: `src/app/user/check-in/page.tsx`

- Reverted to direct Supabase query instead of database function
- Added comprehensive error handling and debugging
- Added fallback query logic for reliability
- Added debug tools for troubleshooting

### 3. Added Debug Tools

**File**: `src/app/api/debug/checkin-history/route.ts`

- API endpoint to test database queries
- Helps identify specific query failures
- Provides detailed error information

### 4. Added Data Integrity Utilities

**File**: `src/lib/utils/fix-checkin-data.ts`

- `fixCheckinDataInconsistencies()` - Cleans up data issues
- `validateCheckinDataIntegrity()` - Validates data consistency
- **NEW**: `fixSpecificGearIssues()` - Targets specific problematic gear records

### 5. Updated Admin Database Settings

**File**: `src/app/admin/settings/database/page.tsx`

- Added utilities to validate and fix data inconsistencies
- Provides admin interface to run data cleanup operations
- **NEW**: "Fix Specific Gear Issues" button
- **NEW**: "Run Database Migration" button

### 6. Added Migration Runner

**File**: `src/app/api/debug/run-migration/route.ts`

- API endpoint to run database migrations
- Handles data cleanup and constraint creation
- Provides detailed results of migration steps

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Run Database Migration

1. Navigate to `/admin/settings/database`
2. Click "Run Database Migration"
3. Check console for migration results

### 2. Fix Specific Gear Issues

1. Still on `/admin/settings/database`
2. Click "Fix Specific Gear Issues"
3. This should clear the problematic items from user check-in pages

### 3. Test User Check-in Flow

1. Navigate to `/user/check-in` page
2. Check that problematic items are no longer showing
3. Verify that check-in history shows proper gear names
4. Test the complete check-in approval workflow

### 4. Use Debug Tools

1. Click "Debug Query" button on check-in page (development mode)
2. Check browser console for detailed information
3. Visit `/api/debug/checkin-history` for server-side debugging

## Prevention

The implemented fixes include:

1. **Database Triggers**: Automatically maintain data consistency
2. **Foreign Key Constraints**: Prevent orphaned records
3. **Improved Queries**: More reliable data retrieval
4. **Admin Utilities**: Tools to detect and fix issues
5. **Debug Tools**: Help troubleshoot future issues
6. **Specific Data Cleanup**: Target problematic gear records

## Monitoring

To monitor for future issues:

1. **Regular Validation**: Run data integrity validation periodically
2. **Log Monitoring**: Watch for errors in check-in related operations
3. **User Feedback**: Monitor user reports of similar issues
4. **Debug Tools**: Use the debug endpoints when issues arise

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur with the fixes:

1. **Database**: The migration can be rolled back by dropping the new constraints and functions
2. **Code**: Revert to previous versions of the modified files
3. **Data**: Use the admin utilities to restore data consistency
