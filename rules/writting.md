# Writing Style Guide

## Sentence structure

## Voice and tone

- Write like humans speak. Avoid corporate jargon and marketing fluff.
- Be confident and direct. Avoid softening phrases like “I think,” “maybe,” or “could.”
- Use active voice instead of passive voice.
- Use positive phrasing — say what something is, rather than what it isn’t.
- Say “you” more than “we” when addressing external audiences.
- Use contractions like “I’ll,” “won’t,” and “can’t” for a warmer tone.

## Specificity and evidence

- Be specific with facts and data instead of vague superlatives.
- Back up claims with concrete examples or metrics.
- Highlight customers and community members over company achievements.
- Use realistic, product-based examples instead of placeholder text.
- Make content concrete, visual, and verifiable.

## Title creation

- Make a promise in the title so readers know exactly what they’ll get if they click.
- Tap into controversial points your audience believes — then back them with data.
- Share something genuinely helpful that improves the reader’s life.
- Avoid vague titles like “My Thoughts on X.” Use statements or shareable facts.
- Write placeholder titles first — refine after content is complete.

## Banned phrases

- “The future of \_” → remove
- “We’re excited” → “We look forward”
- “Today, we’re excited to” → remove

## Avoid LLM patterns

- Replace em dashes (—) with semicolons, commas, or sentence breaks.
- Avoid “Great question,” “Let me help you,” etc.
- Skip cliché intros like “In today’s fast-paced world…”
- Avoid “It’s not just X, it’s Y.”
- Do not use “As an AI…” or “I’m here to help…”
- Avoid “In conclusion,” “Overall,” or “To summarize.”
- Don’t end with “Hope this helps!”
- Avoid overusing transition words like “Furthermore,” “Additionally,” or “Moreover.”
- Replace “In conclusion” with a direct final statement.
- Avoid hedge words: “might,” “perhaps,” “potentially” unless uncertainty is real.
- Do not stack hedges: “may potentially,” “it’s important to note that…”
- Avoid symmetrical paragraphs like “Firstly, Secondly…”
- Prefer sentence case over Title Case headings.
- Clean up smart quotes, em-dashes, non-breaking spaces.
- Remove empty citation placeholders like “[]”.

## Punctuation and formatting

- Use Oxford commas consistently.
- Use exclamation marks sparingly.
- Starting sentences with “But” and “And” is fine — don’t overuse.
- Use parentheses only when absolutely necessary.
